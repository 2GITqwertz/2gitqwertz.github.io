        <h1>Resources and Reading</h1>

        <p>Breazee is inspired by established breathing practices and ongoing discussions around conscious breathing.</p>
        <p>If you would like to explore the topic in more depth, the following resources provide additional background and perspectives.</p>
        <p>The recommendations below are intended for general information and personal interest.</p>

        <h2>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</h2>
        <p>by James Nestor</p>
        <p>A widely discussed book that explores the science, history, and cultural aspects of breathing.</p>
        <p>It looks at how different breathing patterns have been practiced and studied across time and across cultures.</p>
        <p>The book combines research, personal experiences, and interviews to provide a broad overview of how breathing techniques are approached today.</p>
